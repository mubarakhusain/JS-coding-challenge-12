# JS-coding-challenge-6
Challenge: 
On click of every “add to cart” button on your webpages, add product ids to cart using local storage.
• Create a cart page based on the mockups provided with products of these ids and their editable quantity, calculated price based on that, and a subtotal based on all prices, and a total based on subtotal, taxes and shipping cost.
• Add a delete button on cart page to fadeout the div and items from cart. Remove those entries from local storage cart as well.
